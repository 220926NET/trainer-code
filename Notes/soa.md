# Service Oriented Architecture
- Web Services are services offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the Internet
Instead of having a monolithic architecture where the relationship between ui logic and backend logic is tightly bound, create web services that can serve many different types of devices/users/apps/programs.
Essentially more modular way to design your app, so it can be flexible in who it serves.

## SOA Principles
These are some of the guiding principles to help design your web services
- Service Contract
    - Your service, should operate based on a standardized contract
- Service Composability
    - should be small, and be composed of other services that does one thing well
- Loosely Coupled
    - your services should not be codependent/tightly coupled/in other services business
- Abstraction
    - Your service should not show its gut - aka, provide a simple interface for users to use
