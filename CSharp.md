# C#

## What is C#?

## What is compiling?
Compiling is a process of translating a program code to something machines can understand (aka machine code, aka 0's and 1's)

## What is Type Safety?
Type safety means that whenever you create a variable, you have to let the compiler know which data type you plan on assigning to that variable.

## What is Object Oriented?
Object oriented programming is one of paradigms of computer programming where the data and the behavior is bundled together as an object and the program is defined by the relationship between those objects (way more on this later)
