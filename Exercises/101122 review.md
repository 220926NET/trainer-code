# SQL Terms

- Database
	- Structured set of data held in computer that is persisted beyond the runtime of program and can be accessed later on
	- Databases are areas of structured information or data stores
	- A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. - Oracle

- Relational Database
	- A Relational Database organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table. Data is typically structured across multiple tables, which can be joined together via a primary key or a foreign key. These unique identifiers demonstrate the different relationships which exist between tables, and these relationships are usually illustrated through different types of data models.
	- Items in a relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Relational database technology provides the most efficient and flexible way to access structured information. - Oracle
	- A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to interrelated data points.

- SQL Dialects
	- These are different implementations of SQL provided by diff vendors
	- PostgreSQL, Sql Server, MySQL, Oracle SQL, Maria SQL, etc.

- Normalization
	- reducing pointless data, grouping similar data, prevent changing data
	- Normalization is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and improve data
	- Normalization is a database design technique which organizes tables in a way that reduces repetition/dependency of data.

	- Key
		- The set of attributes that are used to identify the specific row in a table and to find or create the relation between two or more tables i.e keys identify the rows by combining one or more columns. SQL provides super key, primary key, candidate key, alternate key, foreign key, compound key, composite key, and surrogate key. SQL keys use constraints to uniquely identify rows from larger data.
		- Unique identifier used to establish relationships between different tables.

	- 1NF
		- Each cell should only have one value, and each record should be distinct from the others. No two entities are identical
		- Atomic values, unique(no redundant) rows
	- 2NF
		- 1NF + No partial dependency
			- Partial Dep: When a non-key column is depending on only a part of a key
	- 3NF
		- 2NF + no transitive dep
		- No Transitive Dependency : no non key data being used to identify a row
	- "The data in a table must depend on the key (1NF), the whole key (2NF), and nothing but the key (3NF)."
- Multiplicity (Max and min num of members allowed in a set)
- Cardinality (Participation in a set)
	- Describes the relationship between entities in terms of how many connections the one entity will have to the members of another entities

	- 1-1
		- teacher to one apprentice/student
		- One human owns one dog, the dog has one human
		- One person has one social security number
		- one student has one student id
		- Usually make it a column of a table
		- In cases where the data doesn't belong in a table, PK - FK, where FK is unique and not null
	- 1-M
		- Many fingers to one hand
		- One order with multiple items
		- Wizard to their own unique/invented spells 
		- one mother to many children
		- one class to many students
		- PK - FK : 
		- CREATE TABLE Class (
				Id int 
			)
		CREATE TABLE Students (
			StudentID
			ClassId FK references Class(Id)
		)

	- M-M
		- One record in table A can match many records in table B and one record in table B can match many records in table A 
		- Students and Homeworks
		- Shipping companies and shipping locations
		- Authors and Books
		- Shirts and Ties
		- Multiple rec in table is associated with mul records in another one
		- Join Table 
		
- Constraints
	- Not null : you can't have an empty value/null in that column
	- Unique : Can't have duplicate entries all data in that column is unique
	- Primary Key : has to be unique, can't be null -> provides unique id for each row in table
		- Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
	- Foreign Key : PK that belongs to a different record
	- Default : used to set default value if nothing is provided
	- Check : To check for additional condition
	- Identity : auto incrementing 
- Commands for..
	- Creating a table : CREATE TABLE table-name ( column data and constraints here )
	- Deleting a table : DROP TABLE table-name;
		- you have to drop tables in a specific order if they have pk-fk reference
	- Updating a table : ALTER TABLE ...;
	- Deleting all rows of table while preserving table structure : TRUNCATE 
	- Creating new row in a table (inserting data) : INSERT INTO table-name VALUES (comma separated values...)
	- modifying existing row: UPDATE table-name SET values WHERE condition...
	- deleting a row : DELETE FROM table-name WHERE condition..
	- Retrieving data : SELECT column-names, *, etc FROM table-name WHERE some-condition
- Data Types
	- String data types : nvarchar, text, varchar, char, nchar
	- Numeric data types : int, money (small money, big money), byte, double, bit, float, decimal
	- Date data types : date, datetime, timestamp, time, year, smalldate, datetimeyear, etc...
	- Any other interesting ones?
		- blob (for storing binary object)
		- GUID: globally unique identifier, a really really long hex value, used to create an id that is unique across many computers in a network
