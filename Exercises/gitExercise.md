# Git Exercise
## Exercise One
- Open terminal
- Create a new empty folder in your machine to hold any future git repositories you'll create during training (suggested name: revature, revature-code, dev, code, etc.)
- Create a new remote repository in 220926NET github organization with the following name scheme
	- Firstname-Lastname-code
- Navigate to the folder you just created in your local machine
- Clone the repository you just created on github to your local machine (now you have two copies of repository, one in github, another in your machine)
- Your branch by default should be named "main". Create a new file and write some content in it (can be intro, you can create a readme.md, etc.)
- Stage all changes
- Commit all changes
- Push the commits to your remote repository
- Now the changes you made in your local machine is also alive in the remote repository!

## Exercise Two
- We'll be working with the same repo from exercise one
- Go to the Remote repository on github
- make some changes on remote repository by editing the file you just created and pushed from the local repo and commit them
- Pull the changes from remote repo to local repo
- You should see the changes you made in remote repo in local repo

## Exercise Three
- We'll still be working with the same repository
- In your local repo, create a new branch. Name it however you want
- Navigate to the new branch in your local repo if you haven't already yet
- Create a new file in there and commit it
- Push the branch to your remote repo. Your remote repo should now have a new branch
- On your REMOTE repo (aka github) create a new Pull Request to merge the new branch you just created to the main branch.
- Take a look at the PR (pull request) and accept it
- Now the changes you made in your other branch should be alive in your main branch
