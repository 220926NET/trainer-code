1. Refer to the curriculum. Expect to know most if not all topics listed on the prior week (aka the week you're getting qc'ed on)

2. Make sure you can explain these topics in your own words. Break the "Illusion of Competency"
    - Creating analogies
    - Building off of the topics/concepts you already know (is namespace in C# == package in java?)
    - Explaining to others
    - Teach others
    - Flashcards (ie quizlet)
    - The most important thing here is, you're actively recalling the information instead of passively consuming
    - More senses/emotions you can recruit when you learn something the better retention it will be.

3. How to answer technical question that asks you "what is ___?"
    - What is it
    - Why do we use it
    - How you have used it

4. " A vs B ?"
    - How are they similar?
    - How are they in fact different?

5. When you don't know something and can't produce an answer right away
    - First, see if you know remotely anything related to that topic
    - If so, say it
    - Even if it may come from different industry/skill, if it seems related, it's better to say that instead of idk.
    - Don't say "I don't know"
        - instead say something along the line of "That's a really good question, I'll look more into it/research about it after this"

6. Watch out on how you use technical terms/jargons
    - There are a lot of technical terms you can throw around, but, simpler is better. If you can explain things in simple terms that's better than throwing around a bunch of jargons that you may or may not use correctly.
    - If you don't have a full grasp on a technical term- don't use it! leave it out, substitute with plain language.


## The Soft Skills 
We put heavy emphasis on the delivery of the answers as much as the content itself
- Dress
- Camera 
- Lighting
- Speaking Tone/Speed/Volume - make sure you're not speaking too softly, not mumbling, not speaking too fast
- Rambling
- Energy Level - This is interview/performance situation- bring  a bit more energy for the next 10 minutes.
- Eye Contact: Don't look around (as it can be interpreted as cheating)
- Fidgeting: be aware of your nervous habits 

## Other General Tips
- How to make the interviewer ask questions you know how to answer
    - If you are not ready to talk about a certain concept/topic - DO NOT BRING THEM UP
    - IE. "What are some class members?"
        - and you don't know what fields are, just... don't even mention fields are class members.
        - Lead them to the area that you're strong in
- Second, Don't start the answer by "I'm not sure about this... but... " AND THEN give a good answer
- Third, believe it or not, taking 5 seconds before starting to answer doesn't feel like an eternity to the interviewer. If you need the time to put together a coherent answer, that the time. It's better to take the time in the beginning and come up with a polished answer rather than starting to speak and end up rambling.
