Have great app ideas? Sell it to your colleagues and have them join you in realizing it!

# Steps
1. Have an idea for an application
	- Has to be connected to one of the themes, however vague
	- Prepare to tell us what "theme" it is, what type of API (doesn't have to be a specific one yet) it plans on using, and which features it can have (beyond mvp)
2. Pitch it to your colleagues.
3. Everyone votes, ranking their preferences
4. I'll form teams factoring in everyone's preference and their strengths.
